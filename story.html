                    <p><strong>I was born in 2000, into the vast, endless womb of Xinjiang. My early years of life were a spectacle for the eyes, filled with the vivid colorful hues of the grassland. The scent of roasted lamb, the bubbling warmth of fresh milk tea, the channelings of wind whistling through the valleys, and the chatter of my younger brother. It was a world both complete, limitless, and loud.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Multilingual "Sack":</strong> Professor Li Wei speaks of a "linguistic repertoire," I grew up in a bag of languages, thrown in like Yako Tawada describes. Uyghur. Mongolian. Mandatory. Mandarin. They were all around me; in streetsigns, in the bazaar, in foods. They were distinctive melodies, but all blended together into the soundtrack of everyday life. It wasn't just a matter of being heard, it was a matter of living in languages.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Alien Symbol:</strong> Then there was English. It wasn't part of the symphony. A stone. The silence, the cold, the heavy. It would appear every once in a while on obscure labels or advertisements on the other end of the country, or I guess but, I will add, a string of unrecognisable runes, a code not accompanied by a key. No meaning, no feelings, no "self." It was ghost, a language of silence in my world in 2000-2008. It was a language that was haunting the edges of my sight, but not part of my soul. English was a language of silence.</p>
                    <blockquote>"Surrounded by the melody of familiar tongues, English was just a silent stone in my garden."</blockquote>

                    <p><strong>The Concrete Jungle of Education:</strong> Then came 2008, and with it I came to Shandong, a province that was dubbed as a heavy industrial base of Chinese education. The endless grasslands were now supplanted by concrete classrooms and the towering stacks of textbooks. English was no longer a song; instead, English was a subject, and I had to join my first cram school to keep up with curriculum.</p>
                    <p><strong>Lost in Translation:</strong> "Phonics is just like Pinyin," the teacher said. This was my first lesson, what Professor Li Wei might label "cultural translation", but it was a clumsy one, taught to forcibly map the fluid sounds of English onto the rigid grid of Chinese Pinyin, memorizing words I didn't understand: vowels, consonants, plosives, stripping the language of its soul, fitting it into a box I knew.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Assembly Line:</strong> I felt like a machine, learning one thing after another in an exact manner, copying the letters into exercise books - a, a, a; b, b, b - paragraph by paragraph, page by page of pages. The teacher's pronunciation was imperfect and the whole class recited the same thing together like a chorus of confusion. I was a mechanical parrot, mimicking the sounds without understanding the meanings. I knew how to say the words (just barely), but I had no idea why I was saying them.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I learned to mimic the sounds, effectively turning a language of connection into a sequence of mechanical noises."</blockquote>

                content: `
                    <p><strong>The Foreign Language School:</strong> Then came middle school, a "Foreign Language School." The name promised up, but the reality was still grounded in memory talking. My first teacher was great, and strict. She forced vocabulary into my head through sheer pressure. I retained the words, but I didn't feel them. I had no improvement in grades, stuck in some middle range of mediocrity of just doing everything I was told.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Cool Factor:</strong> Until one day, I stumbled upon a private tutor who understood the mind of a rebellious teen. He didn't show me grammar books, although he may very good at, but instead, he showed me the English world. Opened designer websites, indie game interfaces, underground forums, and suddenly, English wasn't about exams anymore. It was a velvet rope that led to an exclusive club. As Chris Hutton writes, "a user's motivation is completely transformed when they are not just a person who, but a ' Punk rocker,' looking for but a different voice." I was a punk rocker who wanted to be cool, who wanted to be different from the crowd.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Awakening of "Sense":</strong> Motivated by the urge to be different, I began to recite entire texts, not for sake of test, but to have that voice for my own. I developed this “clumsy” technique as a way of enlightenment. Within the rhythm of recitation, I ceased translating. I developed “Yugan”, a sense of language. I picked up grammar (sentence structures, nuances) without knowing. For the first time, I was not studying English as a subject, but a persona I inhabited.</p>
                    <blockquote>"English became my secret code. It wasn't about grades anymore; it was about being different."</blockquote>

                    <p><strong>The Fading Colors:</strong> When I walked the halls of high school in Shandong, I realized it was like a washing machine, flushing out all the neon hues of my "punk rocker" phase. Pressure from the Gaokao (National CollegeEntering Exam) didn't allow for uniqueness; it required uniformy. To be "cool was washed out by needs to survive a system beyond my own abilities" As poet Eric Yip puts it, “You must learn to submit before you can learn.” I submitted. The neon glow of my own discovery faded as the fluorescent hum of the classroom took place.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Weapon of Survival:</strong> English transformed once again. It was no longer a cultural bridge or a personal code; it was a set of data points to be mastered for a score. It became purely instrumental. Yet, this is where my past "rebellion" paid off.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Smooth Path:</strong> Because of days of sitting in vain of vanity, reciting long texts, that "Yugan" I had developed became me, the armor. While everyone else rumbled about the rules of grammar and lists of words, I walked along without getting in their way. I did not have to disassemble the language to perceive it. But it was a cloudy victory. For the next three years my English remained stuck in a plateau – stable, strong, stalling. It was a weapon held away in a sheath, waiting for a real battle to commence.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Dazzling Maze:</strong> Coming to Hong Kong, this was not so much a choice now. And much more of a consolation prize of destiny. I arrived in this city with high English scores on my exams, but a locked mouth. The vibe was overwhelming – complete English immersion on Glob Views. And yet I was still a bystander. I was inundated with the brilliance of the city and by my own ambivalence. I was “busy” attempting to navigate our way through life, but immobile in my voice. I lived in English, but I didn't live through it.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Wall of Silence:</strong> Moving towards graduation, I couldn’t help but feel suffocated by the “involution” (neijuan) among my peers. The obstacle isn’t a word. Nor is it grammar. Because of my “mechanical years.” went forgive those. The obstacle is psychological. I carried a fear of speech, a fear of scrutiny, fear that my voice won't match up to the standards of my writing scores. Not to mention: "What now? I am stuck in my own silence, aware of being able to speak, but so scared to actually try.”</p>
                    <p><strong>The Leap of Faith:</strong> Then, the new school and new project came around – a mandatory presentation with zero room for evasion. It was the “push” I needed. I knew no one else would solve this barrier for me. We stood there, all of us in front of that stage. I could feel the pounding of my heart against my ribs. I hit the words on the tongue. And then something moved. As I began speaking the “shadowy person”, the one of judgment (according to Guo Xiaolu), slipped away.</p>
                    <p><strong>A New Voice:</strong> I didn’t merely present a sentence. Instead, I presented myself. That I, that boy from the Xinjiang grasslands, the parrot from the Shandong classroom, that student who didn’t speak anymore somewhere in Hong Kong — all these, were now actually leading to this moment. Because this time, I finally found my voice, but not in the perfection; only in the bravery to be heard. English is no longer a stone nor a tool; now finally, my open door.</p>
                    <blockquote>"I never lacked the ability; I only lacked the moment. When the glass wall shattered, I found not just a language, but a new version of myself."</blockquote>
